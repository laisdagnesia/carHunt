Python script that reads data from a CSV file from the SSP SÃ£o Paulo, filters it to include only stolen cars, calculates the count of stolen vehicles for each brand and ranks them. 
Then it uses a Flask application that serves a JSON endpoint. 
When accessed via the root URL, it returns this ranking as JSON.
